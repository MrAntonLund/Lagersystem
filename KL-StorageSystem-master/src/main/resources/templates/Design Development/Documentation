Q. DataTables is great! How much is it?
A. DataTables is free, open source software that you can download
and use for whatever purpose you wish, on any and as many sites you want.
It is free for you to use! DataTables is available under the MIT,
with which you must comply (to do this, basically keep the copyright notices in the software).

Q. Really - it's free, even for commercial sites?!
A. Yes! I'm very proud of what has been achieved with DataTables and the fantastic community that has helped it to get to where it is today, and I'm delighted to make it available as open source. Obviously if you benefit from DataTables then any reciprocation is very welcome, be it as a plug-in for DataTables (post your code in the forums), purchasing a supporter package or a blog post saying you enjoy using DataTables.

Q. We can't use MIT licensed software. What do we do?
A. In the rare case that you can't use DataTables under its available license, please get in touch to discuss alternative licensing arrangements.
